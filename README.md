# GolfTour

This project provides a simple React application for organising the Portugal Golf Trip in 2025. The code has been modularised into components and data modules using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for the build.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Scorecard Functionality

The site includes an interactive scorecard system. Navigate to **Scorecard** from
the main menu to add players and record hole-by-hole scores for each course. Scores
are stored in your browser so progress is kept between visits.

## Improvement Suggestions

Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- **Introduce more automated testing** using Jest or another framework.
- **Add linting and formatting** with ESLint and Prettier.
- **Expand component library** for cards, buttons and other repeated UI.

By moving to a React based architecture and splitting the code into modules, the project is easier to maintain and new features can be added more easily.
