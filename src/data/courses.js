    name: 'NAU Morgado Course',
    description: 'This superb course opened in 2003 and is one of the latest to open on the Algarve. Despite its young age, it feels surprisingly mature, a characteristic enhanced by the planting of 500 olive trees. Morgado features views of the Monchique Mountains and is set amongst valleys, rivers and woodland. With gently undulating fairways, deep bunkers and large tees and greens, Morgado is an excellent choice when travelling to the Algarve.',

      'The greens are large with subtle breaks that can be difficult to read',
      'Deep Scottish-inspired bunkers are strategically placed throughout the course',
      'The course is relatively forgiving off the tee but demands good putting skills',
      'Watch out for the wind which can make some holes play much longer'

      'The course requires strategic play and careful positioning',
      'Keep right of the fairway on the 1st hole for a better line into the green',
      'Par 5 4th hole is reachable with a good drive but requires a demanding tee shot'
